I developed in-house infrastructure tools, including a Terraform replacement, and achieved the AWS Solution Architect Professional certification in 2019.</p><p id="91425286_271">However, in 2023, I came across news of OpenAI's GPT model, which captivated me with its groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence. Eager to delve deeper into this fascinating field, I quickly became motivated to learn about the technology behind Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p id="91425286_272"><span class="control" id="91425286_273">But like most of us, beginning with zero knowledge of LLM, it's hard to know where to start.</span></p><p id="91425286_274">After hundreds of hours of reading and experimenting, I've sorted out the best resources to help us get started. Assuming you only have a basic understanding of programming and middle school mathematics, this learning path will guide you through the fundamentals of AI and machine learning, and then help you to build your own Large Language Model.</p><section class="chapter"><h2 id="about-me" data-toc="about-me">About Me</h2><p id="91425286_275">I'm a serial entrepreneur and a software engineer. I've been building software companies for over 15 years, in places like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Silicon Valley, and Tokyo. I studied computer science at the University of Toronto during 2003 to 2007.</p><p id="91425286_276">I am now a self-taught AI enthusiast. Throughout my learning journey, I discovered that mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) can be relatively straightforward. However, the challenge lies in the fact that while there are numerous excellent resources available, they are widely dispersed and the concepts are often unclear to beginners. Therefore, I decided to create this learning path to assist anyone who, like me, is eager to delve into the world of AI.</p><p id="91425286_277"><a href="https://twitter.com/waylandzhang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" id="91425286_278" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow @waylandzhang</a></p></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 22 February 2024</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="what-is-llm.html" class="navigation-links__next">What is LLM</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.6.6-b205/app.js"></script></body></html>
